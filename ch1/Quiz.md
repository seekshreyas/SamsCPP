- What is the difference between an interpreter and compiler?

| Interpreter | Compiler |
|:------------|:---------|
| Machine instructions are translated directly from source code | Translates the source code to object files which are then linked to executable programs via _linker_ |
| Interpreter programs are slower | Compiled programs are faster |
| Distribution relies on the interpreter | Source code can be distributed and then compiled on various compilers |
| scripts| programs |

- How do you compile the source code with your compiler?
    - using platform specific compilers like gcc or g++
- What does a linker do?
    - Linker links the object files to executables containing machine instructions that can be executed on the processor.
    - Linker's job is to tie together your compiled code with the libraries. The linker lets you program in pieces and then link together the pieces in one big program.
- What are the steps in a normal development cycle?
    - write
    - compile
    - run
    - debug
    - repeat
